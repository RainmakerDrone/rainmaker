== Rainmaker Web API and Landing Page

Ruby on Rails app which hosts our landing page as well as our web interface between our crowdsourced SMS controls and our Rainmaker Desktop Software. 
Using Twilio, we are able to allow audiences to text in directions to our drone.
When the onboard timer runs out, the Rainmaker drops cash from its claw onto the winners below.

Inspired by cheerleaders throwing t-shirts to the rowdiest fans, we see the Rainmaker drone having potential applications at sports games, music festivals, assemblies, and more.

In future hacks we hope to make the Rainmaker responsive to both audio and video, allowing it to respond to the most spirited fans.
